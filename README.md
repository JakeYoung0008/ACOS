# ACOS, A Clunky Operating System
The resting place for ACOS. "A Clunky Operating System".

---
Hey there! You have just stumbled upon my github page for the project called ACOS. As you can see, the **"Operating System"** part of it is stil not a real thing, since I am a total noob in programing and C++ and this is my first project. Hope you enjoy!

The project is still in the supper early state, and is currently a simple command line app with a simple command system with few basic commands. However, I am looking forward to flesh out this useless little program into a fully fledged **Operating System** as I learn more and more about C++ with [Learn cpp](https://www.learncpp.com/). Highly recomend btw.

**Desclaimer:**  I know that my code can sometimes be stupid and it could look like I am taking the *wrong path*. But that's because and I am still learning and almost everything will be fixed in the future, *hopefully*. So, please keep that in mind when you are providing support to me which is highly appreciated. And also *please be nice* when you are pointing out any issues in my code since as you already know, *I am a complete noob.*
